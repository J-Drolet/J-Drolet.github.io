				<h2> Summer 2022 - This website</h2>
				<p>
					In order to present the projects I've created in a more engaging manner, I decided to create this website as a portfolio. This being the first time doing website creation, I learned HTML and CSS on my own to create this website.

				<h2> Fall 2021 and Winter 2022 - Creating an online board game using Unity</h2>
				<p>
					For my Software Engineering Project, I worked in a team of 6 to design and implement a online game version of the board game Elfenroads. The game interacts with a lobby service through REST api calls. The lobby service handles logins, game session creation and game session starting.
					This project exposed me to working on a larger scale project, and the difficulties of coordinating as a team, especially when working together remotely. It taught me how to perservere and how to work hard in order to meet difficult deadlines.

				<h2> Winter 2022 - Studying the software architecture of Gradle</h2>
				<p>
					In a group of 4, we analyzed the architecture of the professionally used build tool, Gradle (<a href="https://gradle.org/" target="blank">info</a>). An AD (architectural description) of the software was realized. We focused on the Functional, Information, and Development views for our description. 
					Read the AD <a href="Resources/AD/README.html" target="blank">here</a>.

				<h2> Fall 2021 - Various Game projects using Unity</h2>
				<p>
					In Comp 521 at McGill (<i>Modern Computer Games</i>) I created several projects in Unity focused on a variety of game-related algorithms and concepts.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<u>Projects created were:</u>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Game with dynamically created trees that can be destroyed by firing projectiles. A maze is automatically generated on each run using Eller's algorithm. Play <a href="Resources/Games/Comp 521-A1/index.html" target="blank">here</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							Game example to implement collision detection, dynamic terrain generation and verlet integration. The mound in generated dynamically using midpoint bisection. The insects are moved and modelled using verlet integration. Play <a href="Resources/Games/Comp 521-A2/index.html" target="blank">here</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							Tech demo for effective NPC pathfinding. Both RRT (<i>Rapidly-expanding Random Tree</i>) and A* pathfinding algorithms were implemented. Teleporters and obstacles are created to increase the complexity of the pathfinding. Play <a href="Resources/Games/Comp 521-A3/index.html" target="blank">here</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							Game to implement basic game AI. The squirrels attempt to gather acorns and then store them in their home trees. The squirrels make a plan based on the GOAP algorithm (<i>Goal Oriented Action Planning</i>). The squirrels are also afraid of the player and will decide to run away if the player gets close. The player can enter a "ghost mode" by presing <u><i>space</i></u>. Play <a href="Resources/Games/Comp 521-A4/index.html" target="blank">here</a>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Summer 2021 - Hole in the wall game using OpenGL and C++</h2>
				<p>
					In 2021, I took Comp 371 (<i>Computer Graphics</i>). Our team of 3 were tasked with using C++ and OpenGL to create a playable game in which a series of geometric shapes must be rotated to fit through a wall.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<u>During this project, I implemented:</u>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Lighting code to support point lights, spot lights, and directional lights in GLSL (<i>OpenGL Shading Language</i>)
						</li>
						<li>
							Shaders to support shadows created by the lighting
						</li>
						<li>
							Code to allow the importing of textures.
						</li>
						<li>
							Gameplay logic that utilizes quarternion math in order for shape rotations to occur as expected by the player.
						</li>
						<li>
							Controls to allow camera adjustments
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Fall 2020 - Modeling chemical engineering problems using MATLAB</h2>
				<p>
					In CHEE 390 (<i>Computational Methods in Chemical Engineering</i>) at McGill, I implemented chemical engineering related computations using MATLAB. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					<u>Projects computed includes:</u>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Implementation of the Newton-Raphson Algorithm for finding the roots of a spatial concentration equation.
						</li>
						<div class="projectImages">
							<figure>
								<img src="Resources/390_A2_img1.png" alt="Diagram of how the concentration in a membrane changes with changes with time">
								<img src="Resources/390_A2_img2.png" alt="More detailed diagram on how concentration in a membrane varies through time">
							</figure>
						</div>
						<li>
							Implementation of Gauss-Jordan elimination in order to solve a system of nonlinear equations in the context of chemical reaction equilibria.
						</li>
						<div class="projectImages">
							<figure>
								<img src="Resources/390_A3_img1.png" alt="Bar graph showing the calculation of equilibrium concentrations versus each species initial concentrations">
							</figure>
						</div>
						<li>
							Implementation of Romberg integration in the context of calculating the time spent by a rocket in the air.
						</li>
						<li>
							An ODE equation solver implementing Implicit Euler, the Trapezoidal rule and Butcher's methods. This was used to calculate how the concentrations of species in a reaction changes over time using the rate constants.
						</li>

			<h2>Summer 2020 - Multistep calculator in Java</h2>
			<p>
				During the summer of 2020, I implemented a calculator in Java that would support several mathematical operator like parenthesis, factorials, and boolean expressions while respecting the order of operations
			</p>
