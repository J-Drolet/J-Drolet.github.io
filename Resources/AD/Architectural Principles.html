		<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:72" dir="auto"><strong>Gradle will not make assumptions about how projects should be built.</strong></p>
		<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:251" dir="auto">While we usually think of a build as a series of steps such as clean, check, assemble, ... Those may not always be exhaustive or necessary for a build. Assuming that a build is comprised of such steps may simplify  development at the cost of rigidity.</p>
		<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:263" dir="auto">This principle molded the architectural decision to put the standard build steps in a <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/base_plugin.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">BasePlugin</a>. The usage of the standard steps is not enforced, developers may write their own tasks and dependencies.</p>

		<p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:63" dir="auto"><strong>Gradle will prioritize performance over memory consumption.</strong></p>
		<p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:164" dir="auto">In software, the opportunity to sacrifice memory for performance often arises. Gradle will capitalize on such opportunities by prioritizing performance over memory.</p>
		<p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:582" dir="auto">This principle molded the architectural decision of having a <a href="Functional View.html#gradle-daemon">Gradle Daemon</a>. One of Gradle's main advantage over Maven is its  speed (as described in the <a href="Context View.html#gradle-vs-maven">context view</a>). Part of Gradle's performance can be attributed to the Gradle Daemon which is a lingering build process used to save bootstraping time. In some scenarios, this process can consume gigabytes of memory!</p>
