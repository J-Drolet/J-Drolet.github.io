		<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="5:1-5:34">Gradle is a build automation tool.</p>
		<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="7:1-7:233">The building and compilation of software is fairly trivial for small projects. However, as projects grow in scale and adopt a more complex structure (e.g. multi-project structure), a build automation tool quickly becomes a necessity.</p>
		<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="9:1-9:307">It is possible to write scripts that automate the building process, however those scripts tend to be rigid. This rigidity is unacceptable due to the fast-paced nature of software development. The need for flexible yet performant build automation tools is the main driving force pushing Gradle's development.</p>

		<a aria-hidden="true" href="#architectural-description-goals" class="anchor" id="user-content-architectural-description-goals"></a>Architectural Description Goals</h4>
		<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="13:1-13:332">Our architectural description focuses on how Gradle achieves its functional requirements. Throughout our architectural description, we emphasize and detail architectural elements which contribute to Gradle's performance and flexibility.  Our goal is to demonstrate to the readers that Gradle can quickly build a variety of software.</p>
		<h4 dir="auto" data-sourcepos="15:1-15:17">
		<a aria-hidden="true" href="#gradle-goals" class="anchor" id="user-content-gradle-goals"></a>Gradle Goals</h4>
		<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="17:1-17:220">As a build automation tool, Gradle should have the ability to be configured by users to build their specific project. It provides a framework used for specifying build behavior for both single and multi-project software.</p>
		<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="19:1-19:119">To be more specific, we focus the architectural description on one of Gradle's main use cases: building Java projects.</p>
		<h4 dir="auto" data-sourcepos="21:1-21:33">
		<a aria-hidden="true" href="#high-level-solution-overview" class="anchor" id="user-content-high-level-solution-overview"></a>High-Level Solution Overview</h4>
		<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="23:1-23:387">To be flexible, Gradle makes heavy use of configuration files and run-time configuration objects which dictate the behavior of a perticular Gradle execution. These configuration files and objects are used to extend Gradle's functionality via tasks and plugins. Gradle's configuration-based approach makes use of scripting languages (Groovy and Kotlin), which introduces a learning curve.</p>
		<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="25:1-25:81">Gradle's speed is mostly attributed to the Gradle daemon and its caching feature.</p>
