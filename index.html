				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a recent graduate from McGill University in Monreal, QC. I received a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering with a minor in Chemical Engineering with <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/studentaid/scholarships-aid/current-undergrads/merit" target="blank">distinction</a> and a cGPA of 3.92. 
					I began my studies in Fall of 2018 pursuing a degree in Chemical Engineering. Then, in the Winter of 2020, I took a class in computer programming in Python. That's when I realized that I was much more interested and natural at software challenges than at solving chemical engineering ones. That's when I took a minor in Computer Science.
					From there my love for software engineering grew and by the Winter 2021 semester, I had already decided that I would fully pursue a degree in Software Engineering instead. Eager to enter industry, I loaded my schedules up with classes in order to finish for the Winter 2022 graduation.
					<br>
					Through my non-strightforward path to my degree, I have developed a broader knowledge as opposed to my peers. I am able to blend the general engineering concepts and deep understanding of physical realities that I obtained through my education in chemical engineering with my understanding of computing.
					I also have many years of experience in industry that I believe allows me to understand to a greater degree which business needs to prioritize over others when designing systems and software.
					<br>
					I bring to your company software engineering experience that is backed by diverse skillsets and a natural ability to learn and understand varied types of concepts.
					<br>
					More about my interests; I am a huge music fan and have played guitar for about 7 years. I also enjoy playing soccer and tennis. For leisure, I enjoy playing FPS and VR games and reading adventure novels.
